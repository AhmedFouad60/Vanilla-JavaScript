        team[3] = "sayed";
        console.log(players,team);
    console.groupEnd('old');
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();
      team2[1]="foush";
      console.log(players,team2);     
    // one way  

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3= [].concat(players);
    team3[1]="tito";
      console.log(players,team3);     
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4= [...players];
      console.log(players,team4);     
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Foush Dev',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap=Object.assign({},person,{number:99});
      console.log(person,cap);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
